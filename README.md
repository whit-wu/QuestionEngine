# Question Engine

## Purpose
Question Engine is a proof of concept application meant to demonstrate the viability of Full Stack Web Development with Blazor WASM. The application is being developed using a Test Driven Development paradigm, and will include integration with Github Actions so that changes can be assesed and/or declined for any broken unit tests. 

## Intended Function
Question Engine will allow admins to create surveys for users to complete.  All questions in the survey will be multiple choice, and each user's selection will be saved in a database so it can be reviewed by the admin.
